# np.take()

```python
def take(a, indices, axis=None, out=None, mode='raise'):
"""
沿着轴从数组中获取元素
Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like (Ni..., M, Nk...)
        The source array.
    indices : array_like (Nj...)
        The indices of the values to extract.

        .. versionadded:: 1.8.0

        Also allow scalars for indices.
    axis : int, optional
        The axis over which to select values. By default, the flattened
        input array is used.
    out : ndarray, optional (Ni..., Nj..., Nk...)
        If provided, the result will be placed in this array. It should
        be of the appropriate shape and dtype. Note that `out` is always
        buffered if `mode='raise'`; use other modes for better performance.
    mode : {'raise', 'wrap', 'clip'}, optional
        Specifies how out-of-bounds indices will behave.

        * 'raise' -- raise an error (default)
        * 'wrap' -- wrap around
        * 'clip' -- clip to the range

        'clip' mode means that all indices that are too large are replaced
        by the index that addresses the last element along that axis. Note
        that this disables indexing with negative numbers.
